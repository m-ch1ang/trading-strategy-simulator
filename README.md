### New Car Strategy
What if you had invested the money for a new car into a stock instead? This strategy simulates:
- Down payment invested immediately (either % of car price or an override amount)
- Recurring payments (weekly / biweekly / monthly) over a chosen term (12â€“60 months) invested into the stock instead of paying a loan
- Tracks total invested vs current value, gains, number of payments made, and completion status of the payment schedule
If the historical period ends before all scheduled payments, the strategy reports progress so far.
